# Rice Type Classification Using CNN  

## Overview  
The **Rice Type Classification Using CNN** project is an AI-powered tool designed to classify **five rice grain varieties**:  
- Arborio  
- Basmati  
- Ipsala  
- Jasmine  
- Karacadag  

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2/4)** to achieve high accuracy, and integrates with a **Flask web application** for an intuitive interface. Users can simply upload an image of rice grains and receive instant predictions.
